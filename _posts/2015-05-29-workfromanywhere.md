1)This article was inspired by a talk given by Citrix and Wandera hosted by the British Computer Society in London.  The talk was aimed at CTOâ€™s, managers, and administrators of corporates and gave insight into  managing the trend in BYO mobile devices and the security issues associated with apps leaking data and hackers actively trying to intercept data over wifi using man in the middle attacks.

The talk had a slight bias towards Citrix and Wandera as they pitched new features to the crowd as well as highlighting key trends in industry. For example:

 -Companies are hiring more in-house app developers to build apps in much shorter time frames compared to outsourcing efforts offshore with up to three times the wait.
-A Citrix software web platform that is device and app agnostic. You can have IOS, Android, Microsoft, and any other o/s dependent app deployed to employees in an almost seamless fashion. This should be available in 18 months.
-A tool to redeploy legacy apps to the cloud in half the time
-The user as end-point refers to the independence of being tied down to a single location as per the days of allocated desktops and network ports.  Citrix representative made the observation that people have started to use smartphones as both work and personal devices whereby the phone can be docked and attached to a laptop screen. 
-Smartphones feature a work splicing feature that allows private and personal data to remain separate from each other via the use of a on type encryption and passwords. E.g. Blackberry smartphones.

The downside to all this fast pace advancement is the cost of administering sometimes 100s of smartphone devices all with the potential to leak data from poorly designed apps and the risk of racking up high pay as you go data bills while employees stream YouTube while overseas. Here, Citrix has a system called mobile network management (MNM), that allows administrators to perform actions in real-time as they occur. Wandera, offer security from man in the middle attacks and data leakage from 3rd party apps by monitoring data packets in real time as they pass from the phone up to the cloud based app or storage. 

The take away from this talk was the concept of app centric devices as this truly adds value and delivers functionality when ever needed
