 Design thinking stands for design-specific cognitive activities that designers apply during the process of designing.[1]

Why: a change in paradigm in the way software developers create software. A change from plan based waterfall approach to a more agile approach. A shift from quantitative deduction based requirements gathering to a more qualitative humanistic base of techniques to address the needs of the customer. 

Design thinking can also be viewed as ‘solution thinking’, and employs qualitative research techniques such as ethnography- interviewing and observing to explore the needs of a customer in an iterative capacity.

Can be used as a way to generate a starting point for projects; as a way to explore and probe an area of interest to get at the root; to generate ideas for a later hybrid quantitative study. A common scenario is that of a soft ware engineer rewriting the initial problem statement e.g. From a problem thinking approach the engineer may suggest as an innovation initiative the redevelopment of train carriages for a better customer experience. A solution thinking approach does not start at the problem or solution, but explores possible avenues through requirements analysis with actual customers to find the root cause rather than the symptom. 

In practice this involves talking with the customer, probing with open ended questions and semi structured questions, and this typically leads to the revamping of problem statements. 


The context of the workshop began from the perspective of improving an existing service in the form of extending a tour companies reach from the U.S to European and Asian destinations.  The aim was to explore the customer experience, motivations, basically tacit and nuanced areas that could trigger off a way to improve service. 

The boundaries of the interview spanned the entire holiday experience from before, during and after. Findings revealed several themes.e.g. Before: busy family life and the need for every stage of tour to be handled. Cultural activities were an objective and this was also a desired function of tour company. Having all the required leaflets and travel paraphernalia to navigate effortlessly through the company.  Staying with Family members was also a consideration that tour companies a lacked flexibility in. In fact, staying with family and having tour functionality of guided tours, etc were still a requirement. During: customer service was previously inattentive and not very responsive. After:  

In conclusion: the design thinking mindset, was an explorative design process. It involved the creative flexibility of the interviewer and interpretation skills of the observer. The sentiment analysis revealed that travellers wanted a hassle free trip, with flexibility and control every step of the way. A possible theme to build upon was the stay with family but with the option for guided tours.
