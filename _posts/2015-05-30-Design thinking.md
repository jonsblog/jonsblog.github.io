An emerging  problem solving approach.

Having previously heard about design thinking at uni, I decided to take the plunge and attend the workshop at the BCS offices in London. The workshop facilitator gave a brief introduction of design thinking and its emergence in the software industry, and how the contrast in traditional software development of being given a spec by the client with upfront planning to emerging problem solving approach.

The epm seeks to produce better products by using an investigative qualitative interview based approach that intends to probe deeper regarding key emerging themes, asking questions that prompt a emotional empathetic response from interviewees.  Here journey mapping  and mind mapping are used for this ethnographic research.

An observer, interviewer, and different customers are assigned. What questions, how questions and why questions were used later in the process to probe further 


Intro
Designers arrive at a Solution with no predefined parameters or assumptions and  in this way contrasts with the scientific analysis approach. It allows the organic emergence of themes as compared to predetermined assumptions. The requirements gathering phase is an in person face to face affair to where interviewing allows the observer to probe potential themes in greater depth. The open nature of questioning allows one to probe further…a semi structured interview can help with questioning and exploring facets of a potential solution. 

The workshop:
We were given a design brief that specifically required the interviewing of existing U.S customers looking to fly into Europe. The aim is to determine the needs of the stakeholder within the value chain.

1)	Described a quick brief: thanks for your time this interview is informal and the aim here is just for you to speak freely. All data will be held in confidence and results will be anonymised. 
2)	What's your name, age, profession, status, family, single.

Conclusion:
Themes emerged such as the need for convenience, family orientation, culture, relaxing, automated processes. 

According to design thinking, gathering requirements satisfies the design phase. It acts as a start point to brainstorm new ideas that would never have been bought up. If u give the developers the choice they would ask for horses that run faster- ford. Based on scientific analysis this was most likely the case. Now, we find out what matters to the user e.g. Building nicer trains was a secondary priority to improving time taken…u only get this from observation.
